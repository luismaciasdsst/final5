  It all began in 1989 when Nissan unveiled the Skyline R32 which most of us know as the famous “Godzilla”. The R32 was introduced after more than a decade after it had been discontinued because the gas crisis began in the 70s for Japanese domestic vehicles. After the crisis was over Japanese economy arose and Nissan had also gained more money and therefore presented a car that preformed amazingly with an inline 6 and two turbos. Gas prices at this time were no longer an issue. They needed a name for the car, so why not bring back the legendary "GTR" badge. Due to the great preformance of the R32, many other Japanese car companies came out with similar cars to compete like the Mazda RX7, Toyota Supra and Honda NSX. The R32 is what started the Japenese car culture to erupt. Now every kid around the world has a poster of these iconic Japenese weapons. It was the champion in group A Japanese racing for about two years resulting in the most iconic Japanese car. Due to such success they came out with later models liek the R33, R34.

<h5 class="ok" style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Americans Were not Happy</h5>
<p style="font-size:26px;">
Japan and Europe both got the Nissan Skyline r32 but the US was not able to obtain it due to regulations that the US holds on imports. Some regulations had to do with that Japanese cars are right hand drive also fuel regulations were in place that made the GTR illegal in the US. Another reason the US could not have the GTR was because of safety regulations that the US had when it comes to accidents with other objects. The 25 year law was passed which meant that this car could be legally imported after 25 years with some other regulations that had to be met.The R35 was introduced for the first time in the United States but it no lomger had the "Skyline" "Godzilla" repuation behind it becuase it was no longer a Skyline.
